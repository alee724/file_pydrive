# file_pydrive
A repository for code that is designed specifically only for interacting with a google drive account to save/upload or retrieve/download content from the drive

# Notes
- interestingly, if you visit all possible files prior to making or editing files, it makes the program SIGNIFICANTLY faster. With some simple time.time functions, with a relatively small sample size the efficiency is 10x higher 
- will not be using this for the scheduler as it is way too slow and I discovered google cloud hosts sql and other services
